Before you begin contributing, we ask that you familiarize yourself with our project and follow these guidelines to ensure a positive and productive experience for everyone.

## Code of Conduct

As a contributor to Vontigo, you are expected to adhere to our Code of Conduct. This includes being respectful of others, not engaging in harassment or discrimination, and keeping discussions focused and constructive.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Vontigo or open-source development in general, we recommend that you start by exploring the project's issue tracker on GitHub. This is a great way to get a sense of the project's current state, as well as to identify areas where your contributions might be particularly valuable.

Once you have identified an issue or feature that you would like to work on, the next step is to fork the Vontigo repository and clone it to your local machine. You should then create a new branch for your changes, using a clear and descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your contribution.

Before you start making changes, we recommend that you review the Vontigo codebase and familiarize yourself with our coding standards and conventions. These are outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the repository, and are designed to ensure that all contributions are consistent, well-documented, and maintainable.

## Making Changes

When making changes to the Vontigo codebase, it is important to ensure that your code is well-tested and follows our coding standards. This includes documenting your code clearly and concisely, following established naming conventions, and adhering to any relevant design patterns or best practices.

We also recommend that you write clear, descriptive commit messages that provide context and explain the purpose of your changes. This will make it easier for other developers to understand your contribution and ensure that it is properly reviewed.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Once you have made your changes and tested them thoroughly, you can submit a pull request to the Vontigo repository. When submitting a pull request, please include a clear and detailed description of your changes, along with any relevant screenshots or links.

It is also important to be patient and respectful when waiting for your pull request to be reviewed. Our team will do their best to review and respond to all pull requests in a timely manner, but please understand that it may take some time for us to get to your contribution.
